In the beginning there existed an XTeam so great that they created a project
for the ages. Through forming, norming, brainstorming they created the best
project idea that ever was. Each member used their talents to the group's
advantage each and every day.

However, the X-athon was right around the corner, and the group was very 
stressed. They were making progress on the project, but they were still a bit
behind schedule. Not only that, but there were rumors that the X-athon might
be canceled due to coronavirus. All of the group members were worried.

But in spite of the virus, their work continued. The team managed to submit to submit their assignments and xteam projects and not get sick.

The team utilized GitHub and version control in order to work remotely and track progress. This allowed the team to successfully implement their Final X team project.
